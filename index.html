            <p>Hello World! A personal mission statement is a statement that defines your values, who you are on how you
                define success. A personal mission statement can be used to guide your decisions and help you stay
                focused
                to meet your long-term goals. A personal mission statement creates boundaries that make decision-making
                easier, as it's easier to see whether your decisions align with your long-term goals.</p>

            <p>The role of your mission statement in your career is to remember and start with the “why.” Starting a new
                project, task or program is often most successfully done when you first consider who you’re doing it
                for,
                why you’re doing it and what the best end-result looks like.</p>
